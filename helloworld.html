  I'm Mohamed Iqbal Fathima Shahani, and I want to become a full-stack developer. I'm excited to learn both front-end and back-end technologies so I can create amazing applications. My goal is to build skills step by step and work on projects that help me grow in this field. I'm determined to keep learning and improving as I move forward in this journey.
